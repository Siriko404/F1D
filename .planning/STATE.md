# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Every hypothesis test must produce verifiable, reproducible regression results exactly as specified in the methodology
**Current focus:** v2.0 Hypothesis Testing Suite — H1-H3 null results; Phase 40 (H5) Plan 01 complete; Phases 41-42 planned

## Current Position

Phase: 40 - H5 Speech Uncertainty Predicts Analyst Dispersion
Plan: 02
Status: COMPLETE — H5 hypothesis tested, NOT SUPPORTED
Last activity: 2026-02-05 — Plan 40-02 executed, H5 regressions show null results

## v2.0 Hypothesis Testing Results

**Conclusion**: No consistent statistical support for hypothesized relationships between managerial speech uncertainty and corporate financial policies.

| Hypothesis | Prediction | Result | Significant Measures |
|------------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| H1a | Uncertainty → ↑ Cash | NOT SUPPORTED | 0/6 |
| H1b | Leverage attenuates H1a | WEAK | 1/6 (QA_Weak_Modal) |
| H2a | Uncertainty → ↓ Efficiency | NOT SUPPORTED | 0/6 |
| H2b | Leverage improves H2a | NOT SUPPORTED | 0/6 |
| H3a | Uncertainty → ↓ Stability | WEAK | 1/6 (CEO_Pres_Uncertainty) |
| H3b | Leverage → ↑ Stability | NOT SUPPORTED | 0/6 |
| H5-A | Hedging → ↑ Dispersion (beyond Uncertainty) | NOT SUPPORTED | 0/3 Weak Modal |
| H5-B | Uncertainty Gap → ↑ Dispersion | MIXED | Sig only w/o Firm FE |

**Implication**: Phases 36-38 (Robustness, Identification, Publication) cancelled as scientifically inappropriate for null results.

## Phase 40: H5 New Hypothesis

**Hypothesis (H5-A):** Hedging language (weak modal verbs: may/might/could) in Q&A predicts higher analyst forecast dispersion, even after controlling for general uncertainty words.

**Why High Confidence:**
- General uncertainty → dispersion is ESTABLISHED (Loughran & McDonald 2011)
- Novel contribution: Does **Weak Modal** (hedging) add beyond general uncertainty?
- Dispersion is direct measure of information processing disagreement
- Data already available (IBES, Compustat, Transcripts)

**Key Design Decisions (from 40-CONTEXT.md):**
- DV: Analyst Dispersion = STDEV / |MEANEST|, NUMEST ≥ 3, |MEANEST| ≥ 0.05
- Timing: Speech_t → Dispersion_{t+1} (next quarter)
- Primary IV: Manager_QA_Weak_Modal_pct (novel)
- Control for established effect: Manager_QA_Uncertainty_pct
- 9 control variables including Prior Dispersion, Earnings Surprise, Analyst Coverage
- FE: Firm + Year; SE: Clustered at firm level
- Robustness: Without lagged DV, without NUMEST, CEO-only measures

## Key Constraints

- Use existing sample (firms, time period) from v1.0 implementation
- Use existing text measures (speech uncertainty) from Step 2 outputs
- All V2 scripts in SEPARATE folders: `2_Scripts/3_Financial_V2/`, `2_Scripts/4_Econometric_V2/`
- Outputs to `4_Outputs/3_Financial_V2/`, `4_Outputs/4_Econometric_V2/`
- Logs to `3_Logs/3_Financial_V2/`, `3_Logs/4_Econometric_V2/`

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- **2026-02-05**: Phases 36-38 cancelled (null results from H1-H3)
- **2026-02-05**: Phase 40 added — "H5 Speech Uncertainty Predicts Analyst Dispersion" (novel hypothesis with higher confidence)
- **2026-02-05**: Phase 40 context discussion completed with full specification
- **2026-02-05**: Phase 41 added — "Hypothesis Suite Discovery" (deep literature review for novel, data-feasible, high-confidence hypotheses)
- **2026-02-05**: Phase 42 added — "H6 SEC Scrutiny (CCCL) Reduces Manager Speech Uncertainty" (CCCL shift-share design using available data)

### Decisions

- [v2.0 Roadmap] 11 phases (28-38) covering 55 requirements; Phase 40 added as new hypothesis
- [v2.0 Roadmap] Phase numbering continues from v1.0 (ended at Phase 27)
- [v2.0 Roadmap] Variables phases (29-31) can parallelize after structure setup
- [v2.0 Roadmap] Regression phases (33-35) can parallelize after econometric infrastructure
- [v2.0 Research] No new dependencies needed - existing pandas/statsmodels/linearmodels stack sufficient
- [Phase 40 Context] Primary IV: Manager_QA_Weak_Modal_pct (novel — LM separates weak modals from uncertainty)
- [Phase 40 Context] Control for established effect: Manager_QA_Uncertainty_pct (so Weak Modal is incremental)
- [Phase 40 Context] DV: Analyst Dispersion = STDEV / |MEANEST|, NUMEST ≥ 3, |MEANEST| ≥ 0.05, 1%/99% winsorized
- [Phase 40 Context] Timing: Speech_t → Dispersion_{t+1} (next quarter, causal design)
- [Phase 40 Context] Controls: Prior Dispersion, Earnings Surprise, Analyst Coverage, Firm Size, Earnings Volatility, Loss Dummy, Tobin's Q, Leverage
- [Phase 40 Context] FE: Firm + Year; SE: Clustered at firm level
- [Phase 40 Context] Robustness: Without lagged DV (Nickell bias), without NUMEST (bad control), CEO-only measures
- [Phase 40 Red Team] General uncertainty → dispersion is established; Weak Modal as primary IV is novel contribution
- [Phase 40 Red Team] If Weak Modal insignificant, frame as "hedging does not add beyond uncertainty" — still publishable
- [Phase 40 Plan 01] IBES loading via PyArrow row-group aggregation for memory efficiency (25M+ rows)
- [Phase 40 Plan 01] CCM LINKPRIM='P' (string) not integer for primary link selection
- [Phase 40 Plan 01] GVKEY standardization to string with leading zeros (zfill(6)) for cross-dataset compatibility
- [Phase 40 Plan 01] Placeholder CUSIP filtering: 00000000, nan, NaN, None excluded
- [Phase 40 Plan 01] NumpyEncoder for JSON serialization of numpy types in stats.json

### From v1.0 (carry forward)

- Stats inline per script (self-contained replication)
- Pipeline follows CLAUDE.md conventions (1_Inputs, 2_Scripts, 3_Logs, 4_Outputs)
- Timestamp-based output resolution (symlinks removed in Phase 27)
- All 21 scripts support CLI with --help and --dry-run
- get_latest_output_dir() for reading prerequisite outputs

### Known Pitfalls (from research)

1. **FE Collinearity Trap:** Firm + industry FE are redundant (firms don't change industries). Use `drop_absorbed=False, check_rank=True`
2. **Interaction Multicollinearity:** Always center continuous variables before creating interactions
3. **Weak Instruments in 2SLS:** F < 10 on first stage means 2SLS is more biased than OLS. Enforce F > 10 programmatically
4. **Nickell Bias:** Including lagged DV with Firm FE creates bias ≈ 1/T. With T=17, bias ≈ 6% — acceptable but include robustness without lagged DV
5. **Bad Control:** Analyst coverage (NUMEST) is endogenous — include robustness without it

### Blockers/Concerns

None currently.

## Session Continuity

### Current Session (2026-02-05)

**Completed:**
- Phase 40 Plan 01 executed successfully
- Created 3.5_H5Variables.py with memory-efficient IBES loading (PyArrow row groups)
- Generated H5_AnalystDispersion.parquet with 850,889 observations (264,504 complete cases)
- Implemented CCM CUSIP-GVKEY linking (LINKPRIM='P', 71.6% match rate)
- Computed forward-looking dispersion_lead (Speech_t → Dispersion_{t+1})
- Merged all 6 speech uncertainty measures and computed uncertainty_gap

**Phase 40 Plan 02 executed:**
- Created 4.5_H5DispersionRegression.py following H1 regression pattern
- Executed 28 regressions (6 measures x 4 specs + gap model)
- Primary spec: 0/3 Weak Modal measures significant
- Gap model: Significant only in pooled OLS, not with Firm FE
- Key finding: H5-A NOT supported; hedging does not add power beyond uncertainty

**H5 Regression Results:**
- Primary spec (Firm + Year FE): beta1(Weak_Modal) = -0.0124, p = 0.99
- Pooled OLS (no FE): Uncertainty significant, but not with Firm FE
- Interpretation: Speech-dispersion relationship driven by firm heterogeneity

**Deviations Handled (8 auto-fixes total):**
1-5. From Plan 01 (IBES loading, CCM, GVKEY, CUSIP, NumpyEncoder)
6. Missing gvkey/fiscal_year in regression subset (blocking)
7. JSON bool serialization error
8. uncertainty_gap not added to regression dataframe

**Next Session:**
- Consider Phase 41: Hypothesis Suite Discovery (literature review for new hypotheses)
- Or discuss H5 null results and next steps
