**Recent Trend:**
- Last 4 plans: ~7 min average
- Trend: DualWriter consolidation gap closure

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 23-03]: Migrated 3.4_Utils.py to use shared.symlink_utils (update_latest_link as update_latest_symlink for backward compatibility)
- [Phase 23-03]: Migrated 4.4_GenerateSummaryStats.py to import utility functions from shared.observability_utils
- [Phase 23-03]: Used custom Python script for complex file editing when sed commands failed
- [Phase 23-08]: Consolidated DualWriter to shared.observability_utils module across 4 gap scripts
- [Phase 23-08]: Removed duplicate import statements from try/except blocks to maintain clean code

### Blockers/Concerns

**Remaining gap from VERIFICATION.md:**
- 4.4_GenerateSummaryStats.py had inline utility functions (compute_file_checksum, print_stat, analyze_missing_values) - FIXED in Plan 23-03
- 3.4_Utils.py had inline update_latest_symlink function - FIXED in Plan 23-03
